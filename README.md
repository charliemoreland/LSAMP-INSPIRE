# LSAMP-INSPIRE
This project is a web application developed for the federally funded LSAMP (Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation) Inspire program, aimed at supporting and empowering underrepresented students in STEM fields. As the Backend Developer and Client Relations Manager, I am responsible for developing the core server-side functionality, API integration, and ensuring seamless communication with the client and stakeholders throughout the development process. 

Major Learning Takeaways: 

User Requirement Gathering
In my role, I led the process of gathering and analyzing user requirements for the LSAMP Inspire web application. I worked closely with key stakeholders, including program managers and potential end users, to identify the needs and challenges of the LSAMP community. Through workshops, interviews, and feedback sessions, I translated these insights into clear, actionable requirements. This ensured that the final product not only aligned with program goals but also provided a user-friendly experience for participants and administrators. 

System Design
I was responsible for designing the system architecture for the web application. This involved creating a scalable and efficient backend structure that could handle growing user data and interactions. I utilized industry best practices to develop a modular design, ensuring that components could be easily maintained and updated. The system was designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for easy integration of future features as the needs of the LSAMP program evolve.

AWS Hosting and Cloud Infrastructure
To ensure a reliable and scalable hosting solution, I leveraged Amazon Web Services for deploying and maintaining the web application. Using services such as EC2 for computing power, RDS for managed databases, and S3 for file storage, I architected a robust cloud-based infrastructure. AWS allowed us to efficiently scale the application based on traffic demands and provided security features such as encryption and access control. I also managed ongoing deployments and ensured that the infrastructure was both cost-effective and performant.
